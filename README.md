## ⚠️ About Antivirus False Positives

For individually developed projects, this issue is almost unavoidable (~~because it requires purchasing a digital certificate for software signing, or even paying protection fees to antivirus companies~~).
The only solutions I can think of are:

1.  Compile it yourself according to the **How to Build** instructions below.
2.  Trust my promise that everything you download from the [Release page](https://github.com/lanyeeee/hitomi-downloader/releases) is safe.

## 🛠️ How to Build

~~Prerequisite you have Rust, Node, and pnpm installed.~~

#### 📋 Prerequisites

-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
-   [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
